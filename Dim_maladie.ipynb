Photo from Dr. Danelle Bickett-Weddle,  Iowa State University ', 'Last Updated: January 2006 © 2006 BOTU_F0106 Botulism What is botulism and what  causes it? Botulism is a severe illness caused  by potent toxins produced by the  bacteria,  Clostridium  botulinum  (clos-trid-E-um botch-YOU-lie-num).  The bacteria grow in low oxygen  (anaerobic) environments. Botulinum  toxins are the most potent known.  Illness occurs either by ingesting the  toxin or the bacteria (which grows  and then produces toxin). Botu- lism aﬀ  ects many species, including  humans. The signs of illness are the  same in all. The onset is rapid and can  be fatal without treatment. What animals get botulism? Animals that can be aﬀ  ected by  botulism toxin include cattle, sheep,  horses, mink, and ferrets. Outbreaks  in waterfowl are common. Dogs and  pigs rarely get botulism and illness in  cats has not been reported.  How can my animal get  botulism? C. botulinum is found worldwide  within the intestinal tracts of mam- mals and ﬁ  sh, and can also be found  in soil or sediment. Animals become  infected by ingesting vegetation  that  is contaminated with the botulinum  toxin (such as decaying hay or grain)  or through direct contact with soil  that contains the bacteria. Cattle or  sheep that are phosphorus (a mineral)  deﬁ  cient are prone to chew on bones,  increasing their chance of ingesting  botulinum bacteria or its toxin from  the environment. How does botulism affect  my animal? Botulism causes progressive paral- ysis, weakness, diﬃ   culty swallowing  or chewing, and vision problems.  Signs of illness can be seen as soon  as 2 hours and up to 2 weeks after  toxin exposure. Severe complications  involve paralysis of the heart and  respiratory muscles, leading to death. Can I get botulism? Yes. People can get botulism, but  not by direct contact with other peo- ple or animals.  People are  infected by ingesting    (oral) food containing the toxins or  the bacteria itself. Reported outbreaks  have occurred most commonly from  home-canned vegetables and ﬁ  sh,  sausage, and honey. Exposure can  occur by direct contact of wounds  or cuts with contaminated soil, but  this is rare.   Botulism  in  humans  has  a  rapid onset (18 to 36 hours).  Ini- tially, you may have  nausea,  vomiting  and  abdominal  pain.  This rapidly develops to paralysis  starting in the head and neck region  and moves down the body to the  arms, legs and chest.  This can lead  to diﬃ   culty breathing and possibly  death.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect botulism? In Animals – Contact your veterinarian immediately.  In Humans – Contact your physician immediately.  How can I protect my animal  from botulism? In areas where botulism is com- mon, vaccines are available for ani- mals. Cattle and sheep should be fed  balanced diets to minimize chewing  of bones. Carnivores should not be  allowed to eat animal carcasses. How can I protect myself  from botulism? Proper food preparation methods  can greatly reduce the risk of botu- lism.  Boil home canned foods for at  least 10 minutes to destroy any tox- in that might be present. Keep hot  foods hot, keep cold foods cold and  promptly refrigerate food to reduce  bacterial growth and prevent toxin  formation. Use proper home can- ning methods. Instructions can be  obtained from your county extension  agent. For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets. Botulism  at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/ DiseaseInfo/ CDC website.

Brucellosis is an infectious disease  caused by bacteria called Brucella  (bru-CELL-a). Many different animal  species and humans can become ill.  Brucellosis is primarily a reproductive  disease in animals, but it can also  cause reoccurring fevers, arthritis or  udder infection (mastitis). What animals get  brucellosis? Brucellosis  can  affect  sheep,  goats, cattle, pigs, horses, and dogs.  Brucellosis can also affect rats and  wild animals including deer, bison,  elk, moose, camels, water buffalo, and  marine mammals.   How can my animal get  brucellosis? In animals, Brucella are usually  spread through contact with infected  birthing tissues and fluids (e.g.,  placenta, aborted fetuses, fetal fluids,  vaginal discharges). The bacteria can  also be found in the milk, blood, urine  and semen of infected animals.  Animals can get the bacteria by  ingestion (oral), direct contact  with mucous membranes (eyes,  nose, mouth), or breaks in the skin.  Brucella can also be transmitted by  contaminated objects (fomites) such  as, equipment, clothing, shoes, hay,  feed or water.  Some animals are carriers; they will  have the bacteria but show no signs  of illness. These animals can shed  the bacteria into the environment for  long periods of time, infecting other  animals in the herd.  How does brucellosis affect  my animal? Brucellosis causes reproductive  problems (e.g. abortions, stillbirth,  infertility) in most species of animals.  Other signs can include arthritis in  cows and pigs, mastitis and lameness  in goats, and oozing skin lesions in  horses (“fistulous withers”).  Can I get brucellosis? Yes. People can become infected  by eating or drinking (oral) raw milk  or unpasteurized milk products that  contain the Brucella bacteria. Direct  contact or aerosol exposure to  infected animal fluids are additional  ways to be infected. People who work  with animals (e.g., livestock producers,  veterinarians) may be at higher risk of  exposure to Brucella. Infection in people causes flu-like  signs (fever, night sweats, headaches,  back pain). Arthritis (joint pain) and  re-occurring fevers may occur with  long term infection. Rarely, cases of  brucellosis can involve the nervous  system, eyes, or heart.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect brucellosis? In Animals – Contact your  veterinarian immediately.  In Humans – Contact your  physician immediately.  How can I protect my  animals from brucellosis? Brucella can survive for months  in the environment under optimum  conditions but can be destroyed  by heat and some disinfectants.  Thoroughly clean and disinfect areas  exposed to infected animals, their  urine, blood, milk, or discharges.  Keep  sick animals away from other animals  to avoid spreading the disease.  In the United States, a vaccination  program is used to control brucellosis  in cattle. Control programs exist for  wildlife (bison and elk) in Yellowstone  National Park. How can I protect myself  from brucellosis? Do not eat or drink raw milk or  unpasteurized dairy products. Wear  protective clothing (gloves, masks)  when handling reproductive tissues  (assisting  delivery  of  newborn  animals). Always wash your hands  after touching animals.

Bovine  spongiform  encepha- lopathy (en-CEF-A-LOP-a-thee), also  called BSE or “mad cow disease,” is a  disease that affects the brain of cattle  and humans. Most scientists believe  that it is caused by an abnormal  protein in brain tissue, called a  prion  (PRY-on), that can cause fatal disease  when eaten.  The disease was first diagnosed in  the United Kingdom in 1986. Since  then the disease has occurred in many  European countries as well as Japan,  Canada and the United States. Most of  the reported cases of BSE (95%) have  occurred in the United Kingdom.  What animals get BSE? BSE is a disease of cattle; however,  under  experimental  conditions,  scientists have found that sheep, goats,  pigs, cats, mink, mice, marmosets and  some species of monkeys can be  infected with the BSE agent. How can my animal get BSE? Most cattle are infected when they  ingest (oral) prion contaminated  “ruminant” meat and bone meal  contaminated with prions. This  dietary  supplement  has  been  banned  from feed since 1997 in the  United States. A few cows may be  able to pass BSE to their offspring,  but animals don’t infect each other  by direct contact. It has never been  found in milk, meat or blood. How does BSE affect my  animal? BSE is typically a slow developing  disease.  Infected  cattle  appear  normal for 2 to 8 years. As the disease  develops, the brain is affected.  Signs such as trembling, stumbling,  swaying and behavioral changes (e.g.,  nervousness, aggression or frenzy)  are seen. Weight loss and a drop in  milk production may be noted. Rarely,  cattle with BSE will become suddenly  ill within days. All cattle with BSE will  die from the disease. Can I get BSE? Yes.  Humans  who  eat  BSE- contaminated beef products can  develop a disease called variant  Creutzfeldt-Jakob (KROITZ-felt YAH- cub) disease (vCJD). This disease is  called ‘variant’ to distinguish it from a  different, genetically acquired disease  of humans called classic Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease (CJD).  Initial signs of vCJD include  behavioral changes and abnormal  sensations. As the disease progresses,  incoordination  and    dementia    develop,  followed by coma and death. There  is no cure for vCJD. Most people die  within a year after signs occur. Most  cases have been in people who lived  in the United Kingdom during the BSE  outbreak in the late 1980s.  Who should I contact if I  suspect BSE? In Animals – Contact your  veterinarian immediately.  In Humans – Contact your  physician immediately.   How can I protect my animal  from BSE? Only a few cases of BSE have ever  been found in the U.S., so the risk that  your animal will become infected  is very low. As a precaution, the  government has passed regulations  to prevent certain tissues from being  fed to cattle or other ruminants.  How can I protect myself  from vCJD? In the U.S. your risk of getting  vCJD is extremely low. Regulations  prevent certain tissues of cattle from  being used in human foods. Import  restrictions prevent BSE positive cattle  from entering the U.S. and there is a  monitoring program for the disease.  BSE does occur in other countries  but most have implemented strict  control measures to prevent the  disease from entering the human  food supply. Milk and milk products  are thought to be safe.

Campylobacteriosis  (CAMP-EE- lo-back-tier-EE-oo-sis) is caused by a  bacteria called Campylobacter jejuni  (je-june-eye), which is found world- wide in the intestinal tracts of animals.  The bacteria are spiral shaped and  can  cause disease in animals and humans.  Most cases of campylobacteriosis are  associated with handling or eating    raw or undercooked poultry meat. Campylobacteriosis causes gastro- intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea,  cramping, abdominal pain, and fever  in domestic animals and humans,.  Young animals and humans are the  most severely aﬀ  ected. What animals get  campylobacteriosis? Most species of domestic animals  including cattle, sheep, chickens, tur- keys, dogs, cats, mink, ferrets, pigs,  and non-human primates are suscep- tible to infection. How can my animal get  campylobacteriosis? Animals can be exposed to the  bacteria by direct contact with  sick animals,  by ingestion (oral) of  fecally contaminated feed or water  or by licking or chewing on objects    (fomites) contaminated with feces  from infected animals. Raw or under- cooked meat fed to pets can also  contain the bacteria.  How does campylobac- teriosis affect my animal? Signs are usually seen 2 to 5 days  after exposure to the bacteria and  include diarrhea (which may have  mucus [clear slime] and sometimes  blood), decreased appetite, vomiting  and possibly fever. Disease is gener- ally more severe in young animals.  Symptoms usually clear up on their  own in 3 to 7 days. Can I get  campylobacteriosis? Yes. People  get campylobacteriosis  from eating (oral) raw or undercooked  poultry or meat, raw (unpasteurized)  milk, raw clams, food contaminated  with feces or unchlorinated water.  The bacteria can also be spread  through direct contact with infected  pets or livestock. Disease occurs 1 to 10 days after  exposure and causes diarrhea, fever,  nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,  headache and muscle pain.  Most  cases clear on their own in 3 to 5 days.  Occasionally, some cases  can devel- op into more severe conditions.  Peo- ple with weakened immune systems  are at higher risk for these severe or  recurrent infections. Who should I contact, if I  suspect campylobacteriosis? In Animals –   Contact your veterinarian. In Humans –    Contact your physician.  How can I protect my animal  from campylobacteriosis? Do not feed raw or undercooked  meat or poultry to your pets. Do not  allow animals to eat contaminated  food or water. If your pet develops  diarrhea, isolate the animal to limit  exposure to other animals and con- tact your veterinarian. How can I protect myself  from campylobacteriosis? Use safe food preparation tech- niques. Wash your hands and all cook- ing equipment with soap and warm  water after handling raw meat. Thaw  meats in the refrigerator, never on the  counter. Avoid cross contamination  in the kitchen by using separate cut- ting boards for meats and vegetables.  Cook meat thoroughly and to the  proper cooking temperatures (check  meat with a thermometer). Wash  your hands frequently after  handling  animals. Wear disposable gloves if you  are in contact with sick animals. For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets.

Cholera is a severe intestinal dis- ease caused by the bacteria, Vibrio  cholerae (Vib-REE-O collar-ah). The  bacteria is typically found in water  environments such as freshwater  lakes and rivers. Cholera is usually  transmitted to people or animals  through contaminated water sourc- es. Contamination comes from fecal  material from infected individuals.    Cholera can  aﬀ  ect people and  some animals and causes severe  diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and  shock. If untreated, death can occur  within hours. What animals get cholera? Most animals do not develop ill- ness from cholera. Dogs may become  infected if exposed to a very large  number of the Vibrio cholerae bacte- ria in either food or water. Outbreaks  have been reported in bison, cattle  and dogs. How can my animal get  cholera? Animals can be exposed to the  bacteria through ingestion (oral).  This may occur from exposure to  feces from infected animals or people  or from fecally contaminated water,  food or raw shellﬁ  sh.  How does cholera affect my  animal? Most animals infected will show  no signs of illness. If illness occurs,  animals will have large amounts of  watery diarrhea  and vomiting. They  can become rapidly dehydrated,  which can lead to death.  Can I get cholera? Yes. Human exposure to the chol- era bacteria most commonly occurs  from ingesting (oral) fecally contami- nated water or eating undercooked  or raw seafood, especially shellﬁ  sh.  Cholera is generally a disease  spread by poor sanitation, leading  to contaminated water supplies. In  the United States, cases of cholera    are uncommon due to modern sew- age plants and chlorine treatment of  drinking water (which kills the cholera  bacteria). Most cases occur when a  person travels to a developing coun- try or eats contaminated seafood.  When infection occurs in humans,  signs develop quickly (as short as 5  hours) and include profuse, watery  diarrhea and vomiting. The disease  may be so severe that the individual  loses all body ﬂ  uids, becomes severe- ly dehydrated and can die. Who should I contact, if I  suspect cholera? In Animals – Contact your veterinarian immediately.  In Humans – Contact your physician immediately.  How can I protect my animal  from cholera? Do not allow your animal to be  exposed to any other animal expe- riencing profuse, watery diarrhea.  Make sure to provide your animal  with food and water that you know is  safe from contamination. How can I protect myself  from cholera?  Avoid eating raw or undercooked    ﬁ  sh or shellﬁ  sh (e.g. crabs, oysters). Cases of cholera are very rare in the  U.S.  Most cases occur following travel  to foreign countries. If you or mem- bers of your family travel to a foreign  country make sure you eat and drink  only food and water you know are  from safe (chlorinated) sources.

Escherichia coli (Esh-e-rik-E-a coe- lie) O157:H7 or E. coli O157:H7 is a  toxin producing bacteria that causes  intestinal disease in people which  lasts about one week. Diarrhea with  blood is typical. Severe cases can lead  to kidney problems which can be life- threatening, especially in children or  the elderly. There are many types of E. coli bacteria. The designation O157:H7  refers to the way scientists classify  various E. coli  bacteria.  Some types  of E. coli are normally found in the  intestines of people and animals but  do not cause illness.  What animals get E. coli  O157:H7? E. coli O157:H7 does not cause ill- ness in animals, but the animals can    serve as carriers of the bacteria. These  bacteria can be found in cattle, sheep,  pigs, deer, dogs and poultry. Infected  animals, especially young ones, can  shed the bacteria in their feces. Cattle  are the main carriers. How can my animal get E. coli O157:H7? Animals, particularly livestock, get  E. coli O157:H7 by ingesting (oral) the  bacteria in the feces of infected ani- mals, or by exposure to items contam- inated with feces (e.g. food or water)  or non-living objects (fomites).  How does E. coli O157:H7  affect my animal? Currently, there is no evidence  that E. coli O157:H7 causes illness in  animals. They only serve as carriers  (or reservoirs) of the organism. Can I get E. coli O157:H7? Yes. Infection can occur from  ingesting (oral) contaminated food,  particularly raw or undercooked  ground beef.  Direct contact with  the feces of infected animals can also  be a source of exposure. Illness usually starts 1 to 2 days  after exposure, with abdominal pain  and cramping and watery diarrhea  with blood. In adults, the infection  clears on its own in about a week. In young children (under 10) and  the elderly, serious complications  involving the kidneys can develop in  a small percentage of cases. Who should I contact, if I  suspect E. coli O157:H7? In Humans –    Contact your physician.  How can I protect my animal  from E. coli O157:H7? Exposure in animals can be mini- mized by preventing fecal contami- nation of feed and water. This can    reduce the chance for ingestion of  the bacteria. How can I protect myself  from E. coli O157:H7? Human disease from E. coli O157: H7 is most often associated with eat- ing improperly cooked meat, particu- larly ground beef, or from products  such as unpasteurized milk and some  processed meats.  Use safe food preparation tech- niques.  Wash your hands and all  cooking equipment with soap and  warm water after handling raw meat.  Thaw meats in the refrigerator, never  on the counter. Avoid cross contami- nation in the kitchen by using sepa- rate cutting boards for meats and  vegetables. Cook meat thoroughly  and to the proper cooking tempera- tures (check meat with a thermom- eter). Drink only pasteurized milk,  juices, and cider. Wash your hands  frequently after handling animals.  Wear disposable gloves if you are in  contact with sick animals and always  wash your hands after touching ani- mals.  For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets.

Q fever (the Q stands for query) is  a disease caused by the bacterium,  Coxiella burnetii (Cox-EE-ell-uh bur- net-EE-eye). The disease is found  worldwide, except for New Zealand.  It can cause reproduction problems  in livestock and severe respiratory  (lung) and liver disease in humans. What animals get Q fever? Sheep, goats and cattle are most  likely to get Q fever. Other animals  that can get the disease include dogs,  cats, rabbits, horses, pigs, camels, buf- falo, rodents, and some birds.  How can my animal get Q fever? Animals get Q fever through con- tact with body ﬂ  uids or secretions  (milk, urine, feces or birthing prod- ucts [amniotic ﬂ  uid, placenta]) from  infected animals. This may occur from  direct contact, ingestion (oral), or  indirect contact through objects con- taminated with these materials (fomi- tes). The bacteria is very hardy in the  environment and can survive for long  periods. This can lead to infection by  inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria from  contaminated barnyard dust. Ticks  (vector) can also spread infection  between animals. How does Q fever affect my animal? The most common sign of infec- tion in animals is abortion during late    pregnancy. However, most animals  do not show any signs of illness with  Q fever.  Can I get Q fever? Yes. People usually get Q fever by  breathing (aerosol) contaminated  barnyard dust or by direct contact  with infected animals while assisting  with the delivery of newborn animals.  Occasionally people can get Q fever  by drinking (oral) contaminated milk  or from tick bites (vector). Symptoms of Q fever include fever,  chills, night sweats, headache, fatigue  and chest pains. Pneumonia (lung  infection) and hepatitis (inﬂ  amma- tion of the liver) can occur in serious  cases. In pregnant women, infections  can cause premature delivery, abor- tion and infection of the placenta. In  people with pre-existing heart valve  disease, endocarditis (inﬂ  ammation  of the heart valves) may occur. Who should I contact, if I  suspect Q fever? In Animals –   Contact your veterinarian.  In Humans –   Contact your physician.  How can I protect my animal  from Q fever? Keep pregnant livestock separate  from other animals. Burn or bury the  remaining reproductive tissues after  abortions or delivery of newborn ani- mals to reduce the spread of the dis- ease between animals. Take great care  when handling these tissues to avoid  your exposure to Q fever. If you sus- pect Q fever contact your veterinarian  for information on how properly to  dispose of possibly infected tissue. How can I protect myself  from Q fever? Avoid contact with the placenta,  birth tissues, fetal membranes and  aborted fetuses of sheep, cattle and  goats. If you are assisting the deliv- ery of newborn animals, wear gloves,  masks and eye protection. People  with heart valve disease, who have  had valve replacements or pregnant  women should be especially careful  around pregnant sheep, cattle and  goats. Eat and drink only pasteur- ized milk and milk products. There is  a vaccine available (in some areas) for  people who work around pregnant  sheep and goats.

Rabies is a severe, viral disease that  can affect all mammals, including  humans. Infection results in damage  to the nervous system. The disease  almost  always  ends  in  death.  Rabies occurs worldwide. In many  developing countries, unvaccinated  dogs and other canines (e.g., foxes,  coyotes) are the primary reservoir of  the virus. In the U.S., wildlife species  are the primary reservoir. What animals get rabies? All mammals can get rabies. Most  cases in domestic animals species  occur in cats, dogs, cattle, and  horses; less commonly cases have  occurred in guinea pigs, rabbits and  a miniature pig. In wildlife, raccoons,  skunks, mongoose, and bats are   major reservoirs.  How can my animal get  rabies? Rabies is most commonly spread  among animals by the bite (direct  contact) of an infected animal whose  saliva contains the virus. The virus is  not thought to be spread by blood,  urine or feces. How does rabies affect my  animal? The rabies virus affects the brain  of animals. Signs of disease involve  changes in behavior, such as unusual  aggression, friendliness or fearfulness.  Other signs include restlessness,  paralysis of their legs, difficulty  swallowing, drooling and a change  in the sound of their voice. Affected  animals overreact to stimuli such as  noises or lights.  Any animal infected  with rabies will die in 7 to 10 days. Can I get rabies? Yes. People primarily get rabies  from the bite (direct contact) of  an infected animal. Less commonly,  exposure to the virus occurs by entry  of saliva, brain or spinal cord fluid of an  infected animal into cuts or breaks in  the skin or mucous membranes (e.g.,  eyes, nose, mouth). Rare exposures  have occurred under special situations,  such as aerosol in laboratory settings  or organ transplantation.  In most human cases, signs of  rabies develop 1 to 3 months after  exposure. Early symptoms include  fever, headache, itching at the site  of the bite, confusion and abnormal  behavior. Hypersensitivity to light  and sound, and difficulty swallowing  can also occur. Once signs of disease  begin, recovery is very rare. Death  usually occurs within 2 to 10 days.  Fortunately, treatment before signs  develop is highly effective and   life-saving. Who should I contact, if I  suspect rabies? In Animals – Contact your veterinarian immediately.  In Humans – Contact your physician immediately.  How can I protect my animal  from rabies? Prevention is the best way to stop  rabies. Animals should be vaccinated  for rabies and kept away from wildlife.  Bats caught by cats should be sent in  for testing. Dogs, cats or ferrets that  have bitten humans and show no  signs of illness may be observed for  rabies under veterinary supervision  for 10 days. If signs of rabies develop  during this time, the animal must be  euthanized and tested. How can I protect myself  from rabies? Do not contact, handle or feed  wild animals. Wildlife or domestic  animals  with  unusual  behavior  (e.g., nocturnal animals wandering  around in the daytime or wildlife  acting exceptionally friendly) should  especially be avoided. Do not pick up  bats that are laying on the ground.  If you are bitten by any animal,  wash the wound well with soap  and hot water. If you suspect rabies  in the animal that bit you, contact  your physician immediately, so post- exposure treatment can be started. For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets.

Rift Valley fever is a viral disease    spread primarily by mosquitoes which  can affect both humans and animals.  Rift Valley fever occurs throughout  most of Africa, and has been reported  in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.  The disease has not occurred in the  United States.  What animals get Rift Valley  fever? Sheep, cattle, and goats are  the most severely affected. Other  animals such as water buffalo, camels,  monkeys, rodents, cats, dogs, and  horsescan also be infected. Severe  disease can occur in newborn kittens  and puppies. How can my animal get Rift  Valley fever? Rift Valley fever is spread to animals  through the bite of an infected  mosquito (vector) and possibly ticks  and biting midges.    How does Rift Valley fever  affect my animal? Rift Valley fever tends to affect  young animals more severely than  mature animals. In young animals,  signs of infection include fever, failure  to eat, weakness, diarrhea and death.  In older animals, infection may cause  fever, discharge from nose, weakness,  diarrhea, vomiting, decreased milk  production and abortion. Abortion  is often the only sign in mature  animals. Can I get Rift Valley fever? Yes, people can become infected  with Rift Valley fever virus. Transmission  in humans most commonly occurs  from the bite of an infected mosquito  (vector). The virus may also be spread  through  aerosol  from  infected  animal tissues or fluids (blood, urine,  fetal fluids), during slaughter or when  assisting the delivery of newborn  animals. Disease in people can range from  no signs of illness to mild illness  with fever to severe infection of the  liver. Symptoms may include fever,  headache,  weakness,  dizziness,  stiffness of the neck, and sensitivity  to light. Rare cases may develop into  a severe hemorrhaging form of the  disease. Most cases recover on their  own. Death can occur in rare cases  and is more likely when the severe  form of the disease develops.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect Rift Valley fever? In Animals – \\t Contact your veterinarian.  In Humans – \\t Contact your physician.  How can I protect my animal  from Rift Valley fever? Rift Valley fever has never been  reported in the United States. The  best method to protect your animals  from infection with Rift Valley fever is  to use measures to decrease mosquito  exposure. How can I protect myself  from Rift Valley fever? You can reduce the chances of  becoming infected with Rift Valley  fever by taking measures to decrease  mosquito exposure such as using  mosquito repellent and foggers  and avoiding the outdoors when  mosquitoes are most active.  When assisting animals with the  delivery of newborn animals or if  handling animal tissues, wear gloves,  a mask and other protective clothing.  Always wash your hands after  touching animals.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococ- cus aureus (staff  -EH-low-cok-cus  are- EE-us), or MRSA, is a strain of bacteria  that has become resistant to certain  antibiotics. It is an important patho- gen in human medicine and has more  recently become a concern in veteri- nary medicine, due to the potential  for spread between animals and  humans. Staph infections, including  MRSA, occur most frequently in per- sons who have weakened immune  systems.  What animals get MRSA? MRSA infections have been report- ed in horses, dogs, cats, pigs, cattle,  sheep, rabbits, chickens and a parrot. How can my animal get  MRSA? The spread of MRSA between ani- mals is primarily by direct contact (e.g., wounds or lesions) or by fomites,  objects in the animals environment  that have been contaminated by an  infected animal (e.g., buckets, brush- es, halters). Aerosol transmission may  also be possible. How does MRSA affect my  animal? Most animals with MRSA show no  signs of illness. When illness or dis- ease occurs skin or wound infections  are most commonly seen. Pneumo- nia or respiratory infection, arthritis or  joint infections may also, but are less  frequent. Can I get MRSA? Yes. People most commonly get  MRSA infections from other infected  people. This occurs by either direct  contact (e.g., hands, contact with  lesions) or by fomites (e.g contami- nated objects such as towels). Trans- mission between people and animals  is uncommon. When it occurs it usu- ally involves close direct contact with  an infected animal.  Disease caused by MRSA primarily  involve skin infections. Skin lesions  may look like a pimple or boil and can  be red, swollen, painful or have pus or  other drainage. MRSA can also cause  pneumonia or systemic disease. Rare- ly, intestinal illness may occur.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect MRSA? In Animals –   Contact your veterinarian. In Humans –    Contact your physician.  How can I protect my animal  from MRSA? Good hygiene including hand  washing and environmental disin- fection is important in preventing  the spread of the bacteria. This is  especially important after handling  animals, especially those with skin  lesions. How can I protect myself  from MRSA? Practice good hygiene. Wash your  hands frequently and thoroughly  with soap and water or use an alco- hol-based hand sanitizer. Keep cuts  and scrapes clean and covered with a  bandage until healed. Avoid contact  with other people’s wounds or ban- dages. For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets.

Bovine tuberculosis is a disease  caused by the bacterium Mycobacte\\xad rium bovis (my-ko-back-TEER-EE-um  bov-us). It can infect many species  of animals; cattle and buffalo most  commonly. Bovine tuberculosis can  spread to humans. It is still common  in developing countries, a source of  economic loss, and a serious health  threat to humans.   What animals get bovine TB? Cattle and buffalo are the main\\xad tenance hosts for the bacteria. Infec\\xad tions have also been described in  many other animals including sheep,  goats, horses, pigs, deer, dogs, cats.  How can my animal get  bovine TB? Bacteria are shed by infected ani\\xad mals in respiratory secretions, feces,  milk, and, less commonly, other bodi\\xad ly fluids. Cattle are infected by inhal\\xad ing droplets (aerosol) that contain  the bacteria. Infection also occurs by  ingestion (oral) if an animal swallows  the bacteria. How does bovine TB affect  my animal? Bovine tuberculosis is usually a  slowly progressive and debilitating  disease, but can occasionally have  a quick onset and progress rapidly.  Early stages of the infection often  show no signs. As the disease pro\\xad gresses, weight loss, lack of appetite,  weakness, and a low-grade fever are  common. If the disease involves the  lungs, animals will have a cough that  is worse in the morning, during cold  weather or activity, and they may  have difficulty breathing. If the diges\\xad tive tract is involved, animals may  develop diarrhea that comes and  goes or become constipated. Can I get bovine TB? Yes. Bovine tuberculosis can infect  humans and the most common route  of infection is from drinking (oral) raw  (unpasteurized) milk or eating dairy  products made from raw milk. Less  commonly, the bacteria can enter  the body by breathing in (aerosol)  or through breaks in the skin (direct  contact). Infected humans may show  no signs, develop infection in the  chest and lungs, or have infection in  other parts of the body such as the  kidney, spine, and brain. The symp\\xad toms of chest and lung infection can  include fever, chest pain, and a cough.  Infected individuals often cough up  blood.   Who should I contact, if I  suspect bovine TB? In Animals – \\t Contact your veterinarian.  In Humans – \\t Contact your physician.  How can I protect my  animals from bovine TB? This is a federally regulated disease  and veterinarians must report sus\\xad pected cases. Animals in states where  there has been TB diagnosed in the  last year have to perform a skin test  to see if they have been exposed. If  found positive, they will be slaugh\\xad tered and tracing and containment  of animals that have had contact with  them will occur. Some wild animal  species (e.g. deer, elk) can serve as  reservoirs for bovine tuberculosis, so  limit their contact with cattle. There  is not an effective vaccine and treat\\xad ment is not advisable.  How can I protect myself  from bovine TB? Do not drink raw milk or eat dairy  products that contain raw milk (e.g.  imported cheeses). Pasteurization is  effective at preventing the spread of  bovine TB in milk. Similar to prevent\\xad ing spread in animals, early diagnosis  and the slaughter of known infect\\xad ed animals will minimize the risk of  human disease from exposure to  these animals.

Glanders is a highly contagious  disease of equines caused by the  bacteria, Burkholderia mallei (burk- hol-dare-EE-ah MAL-EE-eye). Glanders  was once common throughout the  world but programs to eradicate the  disease have been successful in many  countries. Glanders is not presently  found in the United States but does  occur in parts of the Middle East, Asia,  Africa and South America. Glanders  causes respiratory infection and skin  lesions in equine and humans.  What animals get glanders? Glanders primarily affects horses,  mules, and donkeys. Disease can be  fatal in mules and donkeys. Infection  can also occur in dogs, cats, goats  and camels. The disease can also be  severe for hamsters and guinea pigs. How can my animal get  glanders? Horses get glanders by close  contact with other infected horses,  especially through shared water  and feed troughs (oral) as well as  by nuzzling (direct contact). The  bacteria can also be spread by fomites  (non-living objects contaminated by  infected animals), such as brushes,  halters or harnesses.  Carnivores, especially cats, can  get glanders after eating (oral)  contaminated meat.  How does glanders affect  my animal? The most common sign of  infection in animals is yellow-green  nasal discharge and ulcers on the  nose. The horse may have enlarged  lymph nodes and nodules on the  skin. In some cases, they may look  like long, hard ropes, under the skin.  Severe coughing can also occur. Long  term infections can occur in horses,  which may last for several years. Disease in mules and donkeys can  start rapidly (acute) and can lead to  death in 1 to 2 weeks after exposure.  Can I get glanders? Yes. People can get glanders by  having direct contact with infected  animals or contaminated objects. Entry  of the bacteria occurs through the  skin (wounds, cuts) or through surface  of the eyes and nose. People in close  contact with horses (veterinarians,  farriers, other animal workers as well  as laboratory personnel) are at greater  risk for getting glanders.  In people, the disease can affect  the skin, lungs, or the entire body  (systemic). Signs may include fever,  chills, muscle aches, and chest pain;  pneumonia can rapidly develop.  Nodules or ulcers may occur in the  skin or the nose, eyes, or mouth.  Glanders is a very painful disease and  can lead to death without treatment.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect glanders? In Animals – Contact your  veterinarian immediately.  Glanders  is not currently found in the United  States; suspicion of disease requires  immediate attention. In Humans – Contact your  physician immediately.  How can I protect my animal  from glanders? There is no vaccine available for  glanders. Being aware of the signs  and symptoms of glanders will help a  great deal in the event of an outbreak  in the United States. Early detection  of the disease and quarantine of  animals will protect against the  spread of the disease. How can I protect myself  from glanders? Prevention for people involves  identifying  and  eliminating  the  disease in the animal population. If  you see the signs or symptoms of  glanders in a horse, mule or donkey,  call your veterinarian immediately  and avoid contact with the animal.  Wearing gloves and hand washing  after contact with infected animals  can greatly minimize your risk. For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets.

West Nile encephalitis is a viral  infection that can cause encephalitis  (en-cef-a-lie-tis) (inflammation of the  brain) or meningitis (inflammation of  the lining of the brain and spinal cord).  What animals can get West  Nile fever? West Nile virus (WNV) primarily  affects birds, but can also be infect  bats, horses, cats, dogs, chipmunks,  skunks, squirrels, domestic rabbits,  alligators and humans. How can my animal get  West Nile fever? WNV is spread by the bite of  an  infected  mosquito  (vector).  Mosquitoes become infected when  they feed on infected birds. Infected  mosquitoes can then spread WNV to  humans and other animals when they  bite. A bite from an infected mosquito  will not always make a person or  animal sick.  How does West Nile fever  affect my animal? Most animals infected with WNV  have no signs of illness. Infected  horses may develop encephalitis  and  have  lethargy,  weakness,  incoordination, paralysis or even  death. Most will not have a fever.  Death can occur in birds. A very small  number of dogs have been infected  with the virus but generally show few  signs of illness.   Can I get West Nile fever? Yes. Humans can become infected  with the virus through the bite of an  infected mosquito (vector). A very  small number of cases have been  spread through blood transfusions,  organ transplants, breastfeeding and  during pregnancy.  Most infected people (up to 80%)  will not show any signs of illness or  will only have mild symptoms such as  fever, headache, body aches, nausea,  and vomiting. These typically improve  on their own without medical  attention. Very few people, (less than  1%) develop severe disease.  Signs and  symptoms may include high fever,  severe headaches, neck stiffness,  confusion, tremors, coma, vision loss,  or paralysis. Severe cases are more  common among the elderly.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect West Nile fever? In Animals – Contact your  veterinarian immediately.  In Humans –  Contact your  physician, especially if you have  symptoms of severe WNV infection.               How can I protect my animal  from West Nile fever? The best way to avoid WNV is to  prevent mosquito bites. Keep horses  indoors during peak mosquito activity  times (dusk and dawn). Remove  potential  mosquito breeding sites (e.g.,  standing water). Avoid or minimize  lights inside stables during the evening  or overnight. Using incandescent bulbs  around the stable perimeter can help  to attract mosquitoes away from the  horses. Spray-on mosquito repellents  or foggers may be useful; always read  the directions carefully before using.  An effective vaccine is approved for  use in horses. How can I protect myself  from West Nile fever? Preventing mosquito bites is also  the best way to avoid WNV for people.  Avoid being out during peak mosquito  activity times (dusk and dawn). Use  insect repellents containing DEET if  you have to be outdoors; always follow  the label directions carefully. Have  good screens on your windows and  doors to keep mosquitoes out. Reduce  potential mosquito breeding sites;  empty standing water from flower  pots, buckets, clogged roof gutters;  drill drainage holes in tire swings.  Change the water in pet dishes and  bird baths frequently. No vaccine is  currently available for WNV in humans.      For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets.

Newcastle disease is a contagious  viral disease of birds and considered  one of the most important poultry  diseases worldwide. The disease can  vary from mild to severe. A highly  contagious and severe form of the  disease, called exotic Newcastle  disease (END), is so deadly that many  birds die suddenly without showing  any signs of disease.   What animals get Newcastle  disease? Both domestic and wild birds can  be affected by Newcastle disease.  Chickens are very susceptible to  the disease. Turkeys, ducks, geese,  as well as parrots, pigeons and wild  cormorants can also get END.  How can my animal get  Newcastle disease? Newcastle disease is spread by  direct contact with the droppings  or respiratory discharges of infected  birds. The virus can live for a long time  in the environment and can be spread  by objects (fomites), such as shoes,  clothing, and equipment, that have  become contaminated by infected  birds. Outbreaks have occurred from  the illegal imports of exotic birds. How does Newcastle  disease affect my animal? Newcastle disease in birds can vary  from no signs of illness to sudden  death. Affected birds may have  coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge,  depression, and diarrhea. Chicken  flocks may have a sudden decrease  in egg production or produce thin  shelled eggs.   Signs of severe illness include  swelling of the tissues of the head,  muscle tremors, drooping wings,  twisted head, circling, paralysis or  sudden death.  Can I get Newcastle disease? Yes. Infection is rare and usually  very mild. People in direct contact  with infected poultry or other birds  can get conjunctivitis (swelling and  reddening of the tissues around the  eyes. Poultry crews and laboratory  workers would be at the greatest risk  for potential exposure to the virus  during their work. No human cases  of Newcastle disease have occurred  from eating poultry products.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect Newcastle disease? In Animals – Contact your  veterinarian  immediately.  Exotic  Newcastle disease is not currently  found in the U.S.; suspicion of  the disease requires immediate  attention. In Humans – Contact your  physician. Tell him or her you have  been in contact with birds with  Newcastle disease.  How can I protect my  animals from Newcastle  disease? Prevent your birds from becoming  exposed to infected birds. Biosecurity  measures, such as cleaning and  disinfection of bird-housing facilities  and equipment is very important.  New  introductions  or  birds  returning to the farm should be  isolated for several weeks before  being placed into the flock. A vaccine is available for birds and  is routinely used in poultry flocks.  While this can reduce the severity of  the disease, it does not completely  prevent infection. How can I protect myself  from Newcastle disease? When working with birds or poultry,  especially when they are ill, wear  protective clothing such as gloves,  and safety glasses. Wash your hands  after contact with birds or poultry.  Avoid touching your eyes until your  hands have been washed. People  working with the virus in laboratories  or on vaccination crews should take  extra precautions.  For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets.

Psittacosis  (sit-ah-CO-sis)  is  respiratory disease caused by the  bacteria Chlamydophila psittaci (cla- mid-EE-Oh-file-ah  SIT-a-sigh). In birds,  the disease is also called ornithosis  (or-ni-THO-sis), or avian chlamydiosis  (cla-mid-EE-Oh-sis), or parrot fever.  What animals get  psittacosis? Psittacosis affects a variety of bird  species. It occurs most often in parrots,  parakeets, pigeons, doves and mynah  birds. The disease is sometimes  seen in ducks and turkeys, bit is rare   in chickens.    How can my animal get  psittacosis? Infected birds shed the bacteria in  their droppings and nasal discharges.  Other birds can be  infected by  inhaling (aerosol) dust from these  dried infected droppings or  by  ingesting the bacteria while eating  (oral). The bacteria can also be spread  by objects (fomites) that have been  in contact with infected droppings or  nasal discharges, such as food dishes,  perches, toys.  Biting insects, mites and lice  (vectors)can also spread the disease. How does psittacosis affect  my animal? Some birds infected with the  bacteria show no signs of disease  and are called carriers. These carrier  birds can shed the bacteria when  they  are  stressed  from  illness,  nutritional deficiencies, breeding, or  overcrowding and infect other birds  or people.  Birds that are sick may have loss  of appetite, weight loss, ruffled  feathers, yellow or greenish diarrhea,  difficulty breathing, nasal discharge,  weakness or trembling and swelling  of the tissues surrounding the eyes.  Poultry will also have decreased egg  production. Trembling or difficulty  walking may be seen in ducks. Can I get psittacosis? Yes. People  can get psittacosis by  inhaling (aerosol) dried droppings or  secretions from infected birds. Direct  contact with sick birds can also spread  the disease to humans. Psittacosis is a  health hazard for people who work  in close contact with birds, such as  bird or pigeon fanciers, bird dealers  and breeders, poultry workers, pet  shop employees, and veterinary clinic  employees. Psittacosis can also be  spread person to person. Signs of disease humans include  mild  flu-like  signs  (fever,  chills,  headache) and a dry cough. Difficulties  breathing or pneumonia can also  occur. Severe cases may affect the  heart, liver or nervous system.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect psittacosis? In Animals –  Contact your veterinarian.  In Humans –  Contact your physician immediately.  How can I protect my animal  from psittacosis? There is no vaccine available for  birds against psittacosis. The best  prevention is keeping your birds in  a clean environment with good air  flow, providing healthy nutrition and  avoiding stress or overcrowding.  Make  sure any new birds introduced into a  home are free of avian diseases. You  may want to quarantine new birds for  a period of time before introducing  them into your flock. How can I protect myself  from psittacosis? Avoid close contact with sick birds.  Wear gloves, masks, eye protection  and gowns to protect yourself when  working with sick birds or when  cleaning bird housing areas or cages. For More Information CFSPH Technical Fact Sheets.

Tularemia  (tool-ah-rEEm-EE-ah),  also called rabbit fever, is a disease  caused by the bacteria  Francisella  tularensis (fran-sis-SELL-ah too-la- REN-sis). Tularemia occurs naturally  worldwide. It is also listed as a potential  biological weapon. Disease can range  from mild to severe, flu-like illness in  humans and many animals. What animals get tularemia? Rabbits and other wild rodents  are the primary species affected.  Tularemia can also affect beaver and  muskrats. Livestock and pets including  pigs, horses, dogs, cats, fish and birds  can also get tularemia. Sheep are  especially susceptible. Cattle rarely  get the disease. How can my animal get  tularemia? Tularemia bacteria can be found in  the organs or body fluids of infected  animals, which contaminates the  environment. The bacteria can live  for long periods of time (weeks to  months) in soil, vegetation and water  and serve as a source of infection for  other animals or humans.  Animals  get  tularemia  by  ingesting (oral) contaminated food  (raw meat from infected animals)  or drinking contaminated water.  They can also inhale (aerosol) the  bacteria, have direct contact with it  in contaminated environments (entry  through the mucous membranes or  breaks/cuts in the skin), or be bitten by  infected biting flies or ticks (vector).  How does tularemia affect  my animal? Some animals do not show signs of  disease. Illness occurs 1 to 10 days after  exposure to the bacteria. Animals may  have a fever, look tired, be depressed  and refuse to eat. Some will have a  cough, stagger from weakness, vomit  or develop diarrhea. Rabbits and  rodents behave strangely, huddle  together and have a rough looking  coat. Sudden death can occur.  Can I get tularemia? Yes. Humans can get tularemia by    direct contact with infected animals,  inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in  contaminated environments, eating  (oral) contaminated food or water or  from the bite of an infected insect  (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5  days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of  exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu- like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea,  headache and joint pain occur. Glands  (or lymph nodes) may become  swollen and painful and may break  open and drain pus.  Other signs include skin rash, sore  throat,  or swelling of the eyes. If the  lungs become infected, coughing,  chest pain, shortness of breath,  and  severe pneumonia can occur.  Who should I contact, if I  suspect tularemia? In Animals – \\t Contact your veterinarian.  In Humans – \\t Contact your physician.  How can I protect my animal  from tularemia? Tularemia is difficult to prevent  since it can be in the environment  or be spread by insects. Prevention  measures  include  keeping  pets  indoors and away from wildlife. Do  not feed animals raw meat, especially  that from wild animals. Control ticks  and biting flies.  How can I protect myself  from tularemia? Avoid  contact  with  wildlife,  especially sick animals. Do not handle  dead wildlife without gloves. Wash  your hands after touching any animal  and especially before you eat. When    outside, wear insect repellents that  contain DEET. Cook all meats and  foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and  vegetables before eating them. Only  drink water from a safe source.

main­ tenance hosts for the bacteria.\n","Infec­ tions have also been described in  many other animals including sheep,  goats, horses, pigs, deer, dogs, cats.\n","How can my animal get  bovine TB?\n","Bacteria are shed by infected ani­ mals in respiratory secretions, feces,  milk, and, less commonly, other bodi­ ly fluids.\n","Cattle are infected by inhal­ ing droplets (aerosol) that contain  the bacteria.\n","Infection also occurs by  ingestion (oral) if an animal swallows  the bacteria.\n","How does bovine TB affect  my animal?\n","Bovine tuberculosis is usually a  slowly progressive and debilitating  disease, but can occasionally have  a quick onset and progress rapidly.\n","Early stages of the infection often  show no signs.\n","As the disease pro­ gresses, weight loss, lack of appetite,  weakness, and a low-grade fever are  common.\n","If the disease involves the  lungs, animals will have a cough that  is worse in the morning, during cold  weather or activity, and they may  have difficulty breathing.\n","If the diges­ tive tract is involved, animals may  develop diarrhea that comes and  goes or become constipated.\n","Can I get bovine TB?\n","Yes.\n","Bovine tuberculosis can infect  humans and the most common route  of infection is from drinking (oral) raw  (unpasteurized) milk or eating dairy  products made from raw milk.\n","Less  commonly, the bacteria can enter  the body by breathing in (aerosol)  or through breaks in the skin (direct  contact).\n","Infected humans may show  no signs, develop infection in the  chest and lungs, or have infection in  other parts of the body such as the  kidney, spine, and brain.\n","The symp­ toms of chest and lung infection can  include fever, chest pain, and a cough.\n","Infected individuals often cough up  blood.\n","Who should I contact, if I  suspect bovine TB?\n","In Animals – \t Contact your veterinarian.\n","In Humans – \t Contact your physician.\n","How can I protect my  animals from bovine TB?\n","This is a federally regulated disease  and veterinarians must report sus­ pected cases.\n","Animals in states where  there has been TB diagnosed in the  last year have to perform a skin test  to see if they have been exposed.\n","If  found positive, they will be slaugh­ tered and tracing and containment  of animals that have had contact with  them will occur.\n","Some wild animal  species (e.g.\n","deer, elk) can serve as  reservoirs for bovine tuberculosis, so  limit their contact with cattle.\n","There  is not an effective vaccine and treat­ ment is not
